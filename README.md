    Familiarity with TypeScript:
     TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code maintainability and catching errors early in development. Next.js 14 offers built-in TypeScript support.

    Experience with modern JavaScript features:
     This includes concepts like arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators, async/await, and promises.

    Familiarity with frontend tooling:
     This includes experience with build tools like Webpack, bundlers like Parcel, and task runners like Gulp or npm scripts.

    Knowledge of SEO best practices:
     Next.js offers features to optimize applications for search engines, and a good understanding of SEO is a plus.

    Experience with API routes:
     Next.js allows creating API routes to handle server-side logic and data fetching.
