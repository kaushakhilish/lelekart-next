    <p>A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser. . When you browse through our platform, unique cookies are placed on your browser. The cookie's purpose is to differentiate your browser from all other browsers that visit our sites. We can better serve you if we recognize your browser. For instance, the cookies allow us to hold the selections in your shopping cart when you manoeuvre from the order page on our platform and then return to finish the order; cookies prevent you from starting over with your shopping. We can also track which pages of our platform your browser visited and whether or not you purchased a product. That way, we can track things like the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Working with third-party advertising companies, using cookies allow us to provide you with customized banner ads on various websites, applications, customized content on our platform, and customized emails that we believe will be more practical than randomly-generated advertisements and content because they are based on your previous purchases and page visits to our platform.</p>

    <CardTitle>Third-Party Advertising Companies</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Certain companies are allowed to collect information from our platform's browsers in order to serve interest-based ads. These businesses are typically third-party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, or providers of sponsored content. These companies collect data from a specific browser about web viewing behaviours over time and across unrelated websites using cookies and web beacons. They then use that data to predict user preferences and deliver advertisements to that browser that are calculated to target the indicated preferences of that browser.</p>

    <CardTitle>Web Beacons</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Web beacons will be recognizing specific cookies that have been placed on your browser when you visit our platform. Web beacons can communicate information that a browser with a recognized cookie has accessed a page or a specific part of a page on our platform, depending on the location of the web beacon on the platform. A web beacon on our purchase confirmation page, for example, will record that a browser with a recognized cookie accessed that page, implying that the browser was used to purchase a product. The web beacon, on the other hand, does not tell us that you specifically (via PII) purchased any product because the cookie only identifies the browser and not you personally.
Web beacons are used to suggest content and products that we believe may be of interest to you, to assess the efficacy of our advertising campaigns, and to improve our platform by recognizing the pages that are visited and whether those visits result in purchases. Web beacons also enable the third-party advertising companies with whom we collaborate to select and serve banner advertisements to your browser that you are likely to be interested in.</p>

    <CardTitle>What Information Do We Collect?</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent className='flex flex-col gap-3'>
    <p>We collect PII at various touch points, such as when you register with our platform, make a purchase on one of our platforms, or use any of our services in any other way. We combine PII collected from you on the platform with PII obtained from third parties, which include our credible business partners and social media platforms.</p>

    <p>Your browsing information automatically gets collected when you visit our platform. This type of browsing data is associated with an anonymous IP identifier and is not associated with you personally. If this browsing information is linked to information that can be used to personally identify you, we will treat it as PII.</p>

    <p>Every so often, you may provide us with, and we may collect from you, third-party PII (for instance, for delivery purposes). It is your duty to ensure that any third-party PII you provide us with is aware of: a) this Privacy Policy; and b) the fact that you are sharing their PII with us.</p>

    <p>While you have the option of using a pseudonym or remaining anonymous when dealing with us, doing so may thwart us from providing you with products and services or for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This is especially applicable when you buy goods online or need them delivered to your registered postal address.</p>

    <p>You are not required to provide any PII to us; however, if you do not, we will not be in a situation to provide you with the products, or services, or benefits requested by you.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of this Policy, any information you share about yourself, whether PII or not, in an open public forum – in user-generated content elements of our platform, on a social network – will be considered public information. Although we value and sometimes request your feedback, it is best not to post it if you are not comfortable with the feedback getting public.</p>

    <CardTitle>Who Collects Information?</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>When you interact with us via our platform, call centres, associated entities, service providers, applications, our website, or mobile website, we collect information from you. We may also obtain information about you from third parties, such as social media platforms or our trusted business partners, who gather information from you on our behalf in order to assist us in operating our platform and providing services of interest to you. We may obtain your PII from third parties who choose to share it with us. Please also consider our dependable business partners.</p>

    <p>Third-party advertising companies are also allowed to collect your browsing information in order to provide ads tailored to your interests on our behalf. For further information on interest-based ads and your options regarding your data, see the "Interest-Based Advertising Section" below.</p>

    <p>When you interact with us through our platform, we may collect information in a variety of ways. It may be gathered in obvious, active ways, such as when you make a purchase when you provide your details, such as name and address or other information when using the customer service chat feature, when entering a contest or sweepstakes, or when uploading a photo or product review to our platform. It may also be collected in a passive manner or automatically when you visit and navigate our platform via cookies and web beacons, which capture your browsing information and allow us and third-party advertising companies to better customize content and advertising to you.</p>

    <p>In general, the collection of your PII, browsing information, and information you post or provide may differ depending on the purpose, functionality, or unique aspects of our application and website.</p>

    <CardTitle>Use and Sharing of Collected Information</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent className='flex flex-col gap-2'>
    <p>We collect information in accordance with this Privacy Policy for a variety of purposes.</p>

    <p>a. Complete transactions and otherwise facilitate your online shopping experience, including product deliveries;</p>
    <p>b. Provide you with product and service information and promotional materials;</p>
    <p>c. Respond to any questions, comments, complaints, or other correspondence you may have with us;</p>
    <p>d. Make it easier for you to participate in competitions, promotions, and special offers.</p>

    <p>We use your browsing data to analyze our platform, consumer behavior, and services and offerings.</p>

    <p>We use your browsing and shopping history to serve you interest-based advertising.</p>

    <p>We may use details you post in public areas (whether on a third-party social network or in user-generated content elements of our platform) to provide you with an interactive social media experience that incorporates elements of your social networking community into our platform.</p>

    <p>All of the above information may be used for administrative purposes such as quality control, procurement, loss prevention, planning, and development.</p>

    <p>We may use both your PII and de-identified data for analytic purposes.</p>

    <p>Your PII will never be shared with third parties for marketing purposes or for any other reason than what is stated in this privacy statement.</p>

    <p>Any trusted business partner who receives PII is contractually prohibited from discussing, disclosing, or using such PII for any purpose other than providing us with the services for which we have contracted. We might disclose your browsing information and additional information that does not include your PII to third parties. In such cases, however, your information is aggregated with that of others and does not identify you individually.</p>

    <p>Unless specifically required or permitted by law, we do not collect or use PII in ways that are irreconcilable with the purposes for which it was initially collected or subsequently authorized by you.</p>

    <p>We may share personally identifiable information and browsing data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>within our family of brands and businesses that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Lelekart;</li>
      <li>with our service providers, which include deliveries, couriers, internet service providers, IT system administrators, promotions firms, marketing consultants, payment processors, mailing houses, and other third-party suppliers with whom we do business;</li>
      <li>with our professional advisors and consultants;</li>
      <li>with our call centres and associated entities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These parties follow their own privacy policies that govern the way they handle PII.</p>

    <p>If Lelekart or one of its associated entities is sold, merged, or acquired, or if we transfer some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer PII and browsing information as part of that transaction. You will have the option to opt-out of any such transfer if, in our opinion, it will result in the handling of your personally identifiable information in a manner that is materially inconsistent with that described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>In case we want to share your PII with other third parties either for marketing purposes or otherwise use your details in a way that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. In that case, we will first obtain your consent.</p>

You have several options for controlling how we use any PII you provide in connection with promotional communications.</p>
  
  <p>You can access, update, or correct your choices and settings when you create an account or click "Sign In" from any page on our platform.</p>
  
  <p>If your personal information, such as your address or phone number, changes, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kumaracheles@gmail.com">kumaracheles@gmail.com</a> if you wish to do so.</p>
  
  <p>If you get email marketing communications from us on behalf of one of our brands and wish to opt-out of receiving such communications in the future from that brand, click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the end of the promotional email.</p>
  
  <p>Unless a local law exception applies, we will provide you with a copy of any PII that we hold about you upon receiving a written request. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:kumaracheles@gmail.com">kumaracheles@gmail.com</a> if you wish to do so. If you are unable to correct your PII through your account or are facing any issue managing your communication preferences, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:kumaracheles@gmail.com">kumaracheles@gmail.com</a>, and we will take reasonable steps to correct that information, unless a local law exemption applies.</p>
  
  <p>Feel free to write to us at any time to request to make amendments in certain PII that you believe are incorrect or irrelevant or to request that we block, erase, or otherwise remove your PII.

  <p>Please be informed that some of the user content you provide to us and that appears on our platform (for example, photos you submit to participate in competitions or for review) may be stored and controlled by third-party providers. While we will be taking reasonable steps to comply with your requests regarding your PII, this may not be possible in some limited circumstances. If such is the case, we will try to provide you with the contact information for the appropriate third-party provider so that you can contact them directly.</p>
  
  <p>You may revoke or withdraw your consent to provide us with your PII at any time by writing to us. However, such behavior may make it impossible for us to assist you further via our platform.</p>

<div className='pb-6 w-full text-gray-400 font-bold'>
  <p>Although our systems do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, several of the third-party advertising companies that use cookies on our platform to provide interest-based advertising allow you to opt-out of those practices. If you want to learn more about interest-based advertising and see what options you have regarding how companies use your information, please visit <a href="http://aboutads.info/choices/">http://aboutads.info/choices/</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. Neither do we control nor operate these websites, nor are we responsible for the opt-out options available on them. The only way to completely avoid online tracking is to configure your browser to turn down cookies or to notify you whenever a cookie is set. Please keep in mind that even if you opt out of interest-based advertising on or through <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> or other sites or services, you may still be receiving marketing material from us because interest-based advertising is only one type of advertising.</p>
</div>

<div className='font-bold text-xl w-full pt-6'>CONTROLLING COOKIES</div>
<div className='pb-6 w-full text-gray-400 font-bold'>
  <p>Because cookies and web beacons are the technologies that are generally used to collect browsing information, you can block cookies to control data collection related to interest-based advertising. Typically, you can do so through your browser. Check the technical information for your browser for instructions. Preventing your browser from accepting cookies precludes the collection of your browsing information for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertisements. It may, however, disable or interfere with shopping features on our sites and other sites that you visit. Cookies, for example, enable us to save your shopping cart selections when you navigate away from the order page and then return to finish the order; cookies prevent you from starting over with your shopping. We can also track which pages of our platform your browser visited and whether or not you purchased a product.</p>

<div className='font-bold text-xl w-full pt-6'>INTERACTING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA ON OUR PLATFORM</div>
<div className='pb-6 w-full text-gray-400 font-bold'>
  <p>Many of our customers use and enjoy the tools provided by social media, and we include links to several social media platforms on our platform. If you use our platform to interact with these social media tools, your experience on those social media sites will be subject to the privacy and other policies of those platforms. The extent to which your information is made public will be determined by the privacy settings you have selected on those sites. You are advised to adjust your privacy settings on those sites accordingly.</p>

  <p>We will not under any situation sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any of your PII to any of our third-party without first obtaining your permission. Outside parties do not include Lelekart India-owned businesses or our trusted business partners who assist us in operating and providing services on our platform.</p>
